Project Description:

This is a full-stack web application built using Spring Boot as the backend framework and Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of dynamic web pages. The project leverages JPA with Hibernate for object-relational mapping, enabling seamless interaction with a MySQL database for persistent data storage.

Key Features and Technologies:

Spring Boot: Provides a robust and scalable backend framework with embedded server support.

JPA & Hibernate: Simplifies database operations using entity mapping and CRUD repository patterns.

MySQL: Serves as the relational database for storing and retrieving application data efficiently.

Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code with annotations like @Getter, @Setter, and @Builder.

Thymeleaf: Enables dynamic HTML page rendering with template-based server-side views.

Bootstrap & CSS: Offers responsive and modern UI components to create a clean, user-friendly interface.

IntelliJ IDEA: Used as the primary development IDE for coding, debugging, and project management.

Functionality Overview:
The application supports CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data entries. It features a responsive interface that works seamlessly across devices, with server-side validation, clean routing, and well-structured templates for enhanced user experience.

Use Cases:
This project can serve as a foundation for inventory management systems, task management apps, or any data-driven web application that requires a combination of modern UI and robust backend capabilities.
